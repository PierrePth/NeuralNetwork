This project was done during my 3rd year on an engineering school. This is a
personnal project I wanted to do in order to understand the very basics of
machine learning technics. That is why the NN implemented are not CNN / RNN but
just NN that uses SGD and sigmoid activation function for the time being.
However, other techniques will certainly be used (softmax, tanh, ReLU, ...).

  >>> Compilation

In order to compile, you must use cmake. You can proceed as follow (from the
root directory):

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

  >>> Runing the executable

The executable needs a few parameter to run, in the right order :
  . The location of the directory containing the training examples
  . The number of input neurons (same number as in the file)
  . The number of hidden neurons (same number as in the file)
  . The number of output neurons (same number as in the file)
  . The learning rate of the network
  . The number of epochs

Using the same example as before, you could run the network this way :
  . ./nn ../data_set/ 1 3 1 0.5 8000

  >>> Input files

I did not spend time on parsing the input, the parser in very simple and C
style, here is how an input file looks like :

<input values (one per line)>
-
<output values (one per line)>

Here is an example for a simple NOT gate :

  > file true.txt :

0
-
1

  > file false.txt

1
-
0

  >>> Explanation of the algorithms

  >>> Features to implement in the future

In order to understand better the problematics and the possible optimizations
that we can encounter while playing with NNs, I would like to implement :

  . Different activation functions
  . Batch / Mini-Batch GD
  . Regression
  . Techniques to prevent overfitting

Some other techniques could be implemented, but I will do that on an other
project, using the TensorFlow software library.
